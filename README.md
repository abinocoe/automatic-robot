#RedRobot

##To run:
Copy path of index.html and paste into your browser. Chrome is recommended :) 

Instructions are to be added in one go in the text area. Enter to submit.

###To run tests:
- 1) npm i 
- 2) npm test

###If I'd had more time I would have:
- added styles
- displayed a map of Mars and shown the robots' routes
- tested the calculateEndPos function and functions that run from that before writing it, but at the time the priority was to get as much actual code finished in the alloted time.
